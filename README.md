## About me
I am a hobbyist game developer currently studying a Higher National Diploma in 'Software Development and Games Design' at South Eastern Regional College (SERC).
Ever since I was very young, I have loved video games. I have always found the act of game development to be a truly impressive endeavour, a respect that grew even further through my own attempts at creating a game.

## Portfolio
this section documents some of the projects I have undertaken.
### Passion Project
From March 2025 i have been developing a game, both as a passion project and as a learning oppurtunity, in the last year, it has went through 9 iterative loops and is currently on its 10th iteration, and while the game is still early in development, this iteratitive process has introduced me to many fundamental parts of game development, from the process of creation, to the planning of logic and game elements.

All 3D models, texturing and spritework was done by myself using tools such as Blender, blockbench, Krita, GiMP and Aesprite
